#+title: Doom Emacs Configuration
#+author: Grimpper
#+setupfile: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup

* Rudimentary configuration

Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :exports none :comments no :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#+end_src

** Personal Information

It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Grimpper"
      user-mail-address "sergio.pastorperez@gmail.com")
#+end_src
Apparently this is used by ~GPG~, and all sorts of other things.

** Better defaults
*** Simple settings

Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding
the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…"                ; Unicode ellispis are nicer than "...", and also save /precious/ space
      password-cache-expiry nil                   ; I can trust my computers ... can't I?
      ;; scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2)                            ; It's nice to maintain a little margin

(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line

(unless (string-match-p "^Power N/A" (battery))   ; On laptops...
  (display-battery-mode 1))                       ; it's nice to know how much power you have

(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+end_src

*** Auto-customisations

By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src

*** Windows

I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.

First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

Then, we'll pull up a buffer prompt.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (consult-buffer))
#+end_src

Window rotation is nice, and can be found under =SPC w r= and =SPC w R=.
/Layout/ rotation is also nice though. Let's stash this under =SPC w SPC=, inspired
by Tmux's use of =C-b SPC= to rotate windows.

We could also do with adding the missing arrow-key variants of the window
navigation/swapping commands.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-window-map
      "SPC" #'rotate-layout
      ;; Navigation
      "<left>"     #'evil-window-left
      "<down>"     #'evil-window-down
      "<up>"       #'evil-window-up
      "<right>"    #'evil-window-right
      ;; Swapping windows
      "C-<left>"       #'+evil/window-move-left
      "C-<down>"       #'+evil/window-move-down
      "C-<up>"         #'+evil/window-move-up
      "C-<right>"      #'+evil/window-move-right)
#+end_src

*** Buffer defaults

I'd much rather have my new buffers in ~org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.

** Doom configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:

Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no :comments no
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'K' on a module to view its documentation, and 'gd' to browse its directory.

(doom! :input
       <<doom-input>>

       :completion
       <<doom-completion>>

       :ui
       <<doom-ui>>

       :editor

       :config
       <<doom-config>>)
#+end_src

**** Structure

As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).
#+name: doom-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
literate
(default +bindings +smartparens)
#+end_src

**** Interface

There's a lot that can be done to enhance Emacs' capabilities.
I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

#+name: doom-completion
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Language support

We can be rather liberal with enabling support for languages as the associated
packages/configuration are (usually) only loaded when first opening an
associated file.

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face

'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match. Just for fun I'm
trying out JetBrains Mono though. So far I have mixed feelings on it, some
aspects are nice, but on others I prefer Fira.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 18)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 24)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 20)
      doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "JuliaMono")
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :size 22 :weight 'light)
)
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of the fonts within Emacs.
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/font-face.png]]

In addition to these fonts, Merriweather is used with =nov.el=, and Alegreya as a
serifed proportional font used by =mixed-pitch-mode= for =writeroom-mode= with Org
files.

Because we care about how things look let's add a check to make sure we're told
if the system doesn't have any of those fonts.

#+name: detect-missing-fonts
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defvar required-fonts '("JetBrainsMono.*" "Overpass" "JuliaMono" "IBM Plex Mono" "Merriweather" "Alegreya"))

(defvar available-fonts
  (delete-dups (or (font-family-list)
                   (split-string (shell-command-to-string "fc-list : family")
                                 "[,\n]"))))

(defvar missing-fonts
  (delq nil (mapcar
             (lambda (font)
               (unless (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (f)
                                           (string-match-p (format "^%s$" font) f))

        (add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook

                         (message "%s missing the following fonts: %s"
                                  (propertize "Warning!" 'face '(bold warning))
                                  (mapconcat (lambda (font)
                                               (propertize font 'face 'font-lock-variable-name-face))
                                             ',missing-fonts

  ";; No missing fonts detected")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
<<detect-missing-fonts()>>
#+end_src

This way whenever fonts are missing, after Doom's UI has initialised, a warning
listing the missing fonts should appear for at least half a second.

**** Theme and modeline

~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~vibrant~ variant nicer. Oh, and with the
nice selection doom provides there's no reason for me to want the defaults.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-vibrant)
(remove-hook 'window-setup-hook #'doom-init-theme-h)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'doom-init-theme-h 'append)
(delq! t custom-theme-load-path)
#+end_src

However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src

**** Miscellaneous

Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src

*** Some helper macros

There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys

*** Allow babel execution in CLI actions

In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :comments no
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

(defun doom-shut-up-a (orig-fn &rest args)
  (quiet! (apply orig-fn args)))

(advice-add 'org-babel-execute-src-block :around #'doom-shut-up-a)
#+end_src

*** Dashboard quick actions

When using the dashboard, there are often a small number of actions I will take.
As the dashboard is it's own major mode, there is no need to suffer the tyranny
of unnecessary keystrokes --- we can simply bind common actions to a single key!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap ()
  (setq +doom-dashboard-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
  (map! :map +doom-dashboard-mode-map
        :desc "Find file" :ne "f" #'find-file
        :desc "Recent files" :ne "r" #'consult-recent-file
        :desc "Config dir" :ne "C" #'doom/open-private-config
        :desc "Open config.org" :ne "c" (cmd! (find-file (expand-file-name "config.org" doom-private-dir)))
        :desc "Open dotfile" :ne "." (cmd! (doom-project-find-file "~/.config/"))
        :desc "Notes (roam)" :ne "n" #'org-roam-node-find
        :desc "Switch buffer" :ne "b" #'+vertico/switch-workspace-buffer
        :desc "Switch buffers (all)" :ne "B" #'consult-buffer
        :desc "IBuffer" :ne "i" #'ibuffer
        :desc "Previous buffer" :ne "p" #'previous-buffer
        :desc "Set theme" :ne "t" #'consult-theme
        :desc "Quit" :ne "Q" #'save-buffers-kill-terminal
        :desc "Show keybindings" :ne "h" (cmd! (which-key-show-keymap '+doom-dashboard-mode-map))))

(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
#+end_src

Unfortunately the show keybindings help doesn't currently work as intended, but
this is still quite nice overall.

Now that the dashboard is so convenient, I'll want to make it easier to get to.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader :desc "Dashboard" "d" #'+doom-dashboard/open)
#+end_src

** Other things
*** Editor interaction
**** Mouse buttons

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+end_src

*** Window title

I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org ●
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org ◉ doom=.

*** Splash screen

Emacs can render an image as the splash screen, and [[https://github.com/MarioRicalde][@MarioRicalde]] came up with a
cracker! He's also provided me with a nice Emacs-style /E/. I was using the
blackhole image, but as I've stripped down the splash screen I've switched to
just using the /E/.

#+attr_latex: :width 0.2\linewidth
#+attr_html: :style width:20% :alt Fancy Emacs "E"

Now we just make it theme-appropriate, and resize with the frame.

Now the only thing missing is a an extra interesting line, whether that be some
corporate BS, an developer excuse, or a fun (useless) fact.

The following is rather long, but it essentially
+ fetches a phrase from an API
+ inserts it into the dashboard (asynchronously)
+ moves ~point~ to the phrase

Lastly, the doom dashboard "useful commands" are no longer useful to me.
So, we'll disable them and then for a particularly /clean/ look disable
the modeline and ~hl-line-mode~, then also hide the cursor.

At the end, we have a minimal but rather nice splash screen.

I haven't forgotten about the ASCII banner though! Once again we're going for

  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

*** Disabling built-in packages

If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src

** Convenience
*** Rotate (window management)

The =rotate= package just adds the ability to rotate window layouts, but that
sounds nice to me.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! rotate)
#+end_src

*** Which-key

#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote

Let's make this popup a bit faster
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5) ;; I need the help, I really do
#+end_src

I also think that having =evil-= appear in so many popups is a bit too verbose,
let's change that, and do a few other similar tweaks while we're at it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◂\\1"))
   '(("\\`g s" . "\\`evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◃\\1"))
   ))
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Whichkey triggered on an evil motion
